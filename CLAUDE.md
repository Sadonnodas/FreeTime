# FREETIME — working notes for Claude Code

A personal life-organiser PWA for one person (Toon / `Sadonnodas`). Local-first,
static hosting, no backend.

**[freetime-spec.md](freetime-spec.md) is the source of truth. Read it before
changing behaviour.** [README.md](README.md) covers how the code fits together and
the setup walkthroughs. This file is the short version of everything that would
otherwise have to be re-explained.

---

## State: everything in the spec is built

All eight phases of spec §10, plus the §9 importer, plus a visual redesign.
Live at **https://sadonnodas.github.io/FreeTime/** — pushing to `main` deploys.

73 tests pass. `npm run check` is clean.

**Waiting on Toon, not on code:**

1. **Google OAuth client ID** → paste into `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in
   [src/lib/config.ts](src/lib/config.ts). Until then sign-in is hidden, and Drive
   sync + the Today calendar strip do nothing. Walkthrough in README → *Google setup*.
2. **Gemini API key** → entered in-app at *Me → Settings*. Until then voice capture
   and the assistant are hidden. Nothing else is affected.
3. **Running the Notion import** → *Me → Import*.

## Setup on a new machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sadonnodas/FreeTime.git
cd FreeTime && npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173/FreeTime  <- note the path
```

Node 22. `npm run build`, `npm run preview`, `npm run check`, `npm test`.

**The dev URL includes `/FreeTime`** because `kit.paths.base` is set. Bare
`localhost:5173` will not work.

**Your data does not travel with the repo.** Everything lives in IndexedDB, per
browser, per machine. A fresh clone opens an empty app with just the seed projects.
Drive sync (once the client ID is in) is the only thing that moves data between
devices.

## Privacy — read before running anything

`notion/` holds Toon's personal Notion export. It is **gitignored and must never be
committed, published, or pasted into any output.** It exists only on the Windows
machine; a fresh clone will not have it, and the importer works fine without it
(it takes any CSV via a file picker).

## Architecture in ten lines

- SvelteKit + `adapter-static`, Svelte 5 runes, TypeScript strict, Tailwind v4.
- **IndexedDB via Dexie is the only runtime source of truth.** Every read and write
  hits it and nothing else, so writes return instantly.
- [store.ts](src/lib/store.ts) is the *only* place that mutates.
  [queries.ts](src/lib/queries.ts) only reads. The Gemini assistant writes through
  `store.ts` too, so AI writes queue offline and sync identically.
- `deletedAt` is a tombstone; nothing is ever hard-deleted. `updatedAt` is the sync
  tiebreaker — **every write must bump it**.
- Dexie `liveQuery` + Svelte's `$` prefix keeps UI current with no manual refresh.
- Sync is background reconciliation, never in the interaction path.

## Hard rules

From spec §11 and the post-mortem that produced it. These are not preferences.

- **No streaks. No completion percentages. No progress bars. No "overdue" state, red
  badge, or nag.** No weekly/monthly planning views. No priority field. No analytics.
- **Completed items are never deleted and never hidden.**
- **Capture takes one field and no required fields, ever.**
- **A new project / habit / list is one tap and one field.**
- **Every AI feature keeps a working non-AI path.** The app must be fully usable
  offline with no keys.
- **A project has exactly three tabs** (Notes / To-dos / Buy). Widgets sit *above*
  them rather than becoming a fourth. Depth is what killed the previous system.

If a change seems to need one of these, that is a signal to reread the spec's
opening section, not to make an exception.

## Decisions that look wrong but are deliberate

Do not "fix" these without talking to Toon first.

- **A tombstone beats a newer edit** ([merge.ts](src/lib/merge.ts)). Delete at 10:00,
  edit at 10:05, and the record stays deleted. Nothing ever clears a tombstone, so the
  alternative lets deleted records resurrect — the exact failure sync exists to prevent.
- **Untagged to-dos always pass the energy filter** ([freetime.ts](src/lib/freetime.ts)).
  Capture sets no energy by design, so most to-dos have none. Excluding unknowns would
  empty the pool and the Free Time flow would return nothing.
- **Free Time slots fill most-constrained-first** (obligation → pull → neglected) but
  **display in spec order**. Filling in display order let the pull swallow the only
  dated item, leaving the obligation slot empty.
- **Import refuses year-less dates** ([import/notion.ts](src/lib/import/notion.ts)).
  Notion writes `Feb 3`, and `Date.parse('Mar 22')` succeeds anyway — importing them
  would file 43 stale rows as this year, all in the past, permanently occupying the
  obligation slot. Undated is correct; undated things wait.
- **Import defaults every project name to "leave unassigned"**. Auto-creating a project
  per workstream is how the old system grew nine projects of boilerplate.
- **The monthly summary is keyed on being *shown*, not acknowledged**
  ([monthly.ts](src/lib/monthly.ts)). One that waits to be properly received comes back,
  and anything returning uninvited is a nag.
- **The assistant never writes directly** ([gemini/tools.ts](src/lib/gemini/tools.ts)).
  Reads run immediately; writes are proposals until tapped. A test asserts every tool is
  deliberately classified — a write misfiled as a read would execute unnoticed.
- **Model output is validated, not trusted** ([gemini/plan.ts](src/lib/gemini/plan.ts)).
  Unknown id, duplicate, or an "obligation" with no date throws the whole response away
  and the deterministic path runs.

## Traps, found the hard way

- **Google gives a static site no refresh token.** Its discovery document lists no
  `none` token-endpoint auth method, so a secretless client cannot use the token
  endpoint at all. Spec §2.1's PKCE-plus-refresh-token plan is not buildable. Sign-in
  uses `response_type=token` by full-page redirect (never a popup — popups break iOS
  standalone PWA mode); the token lasts an hour and renews via `prompt=none` at app
  start only, never mid-interaction.
- **Gemini does not accept webm**, which is what Chrome's MediaRecorder produces
  (Safari gives mp4/aac). [audio.ts](src/lib/audio.ts) decodes and re-encodes to 16 kHz
  mono WAV. Do not "simplify" this by sending the raw blob.
- **GitHub Pages' SPA fallback must be named `404.html`** — `200.html` is the Netlify
  equivalent and would silently do nothing. Deep links return HTTP 404 with the app
  shell; that status is unavoidable and harmless.
- **`kit.paths.base` is `/FreeTime`** (project repo, not the user repo the spec
  assumed). Every internal link uses `base` from `$app/paths`. `BASE` is one constant in
  each of `svelte.config.js` and `vite.config.ts`; setting both to `''` moves the app to
  a domain root.
- **Pages source must be "GitHub Actions"** in repo settings. `configure-pages` cannot
  set it — `GITHUB_TOKEN` lacks the rights, and the default branch source runs Jekyll
  over the README instead of deploying the app.
- **Headless Chrome hangs IndexedDB**, so the app cannot be screenshotted that way. It
  also clamps windows to ~500px minimum, which looks like a horizontal-overflow bug and
  is not. Verify layout at 500px or wider.
- **Careful with `\b` in Python-driven edits.** A `\b` in a non-raw Python string
  becomes a literal backspace byte and silently corrupts a regex. Caught once by a test;
  scan with a control-character check if edits go through Python.

## Working style Toon has asked for

- **For anything outside the code — GitHub settings, Google Cloud Console, deploys —
  give numbered steps with the exact link and the exact value to type.** Not a
  description of the goal. Console UIs are unfamiliar territory; the code is not.
- **When something fails, say plainly whose fault it was before explaining the fix.**
  After a broken deploy the first question was "so what did I do wrong?" when the cause
  was a bad assumption in the workflow. Lead with that, then the steps.
- Explain trade-offs as you go, and say what the alternative was and why it lost.
  Toon is building this to understand and maintain it, not to receive a black box.
